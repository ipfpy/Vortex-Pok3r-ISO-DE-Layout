## about
This is the default ISO-DE layout of the Vortex Pok3r Keyboard incl. Multimedia-Keys. More Layer from my own layout will follow. Some tips & tricks are from threads on reddit or other sites. If so i will mention them for credits to them and for you to deep dive if you want.

### intention
Made this for documenting my own changes in later layouts to print them out eventually. Feel free to use it :)

### default layout
![Vortex Pok3r ISO-DE Layout Image](https://github.com/ipfpy/Vortex-Pok3r-ISO-DE-Layout/blob/master/vortex-pok3r-iso-de-keyboard-default-layout.jpg)
Manually created with the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)

### basic usage
If you messed up your layer configuration you can press `Fn+R` to reset the actual layer. Be aware that all configuration on this layer will be deleted! The default layer cannot be programmed. But there are layer 2-4 for you to do so. To change the layer press:
- `Fn+M` on the ISO-DE keyboard for layer 1 (no led under `Spacebar`)
- `Fn+;` on the ISO-DE keyboard for layer 2 (see blue led under `Spacebar`)
- `Fn+:` on the ISO-DE keyboard for layer 3 (see red led under `Spacebar`)
- `Fn+-` on the ISO-DE keyboard for layer 4 (see purple/pink led under `Spacebar`)

### media-keys
Since Firmware 1.1.14 the media keys are available with these shortcuts:
(Thanks to this Reddit article:
[Guide Modification Pok3r Media Volume Controls](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/37j3sx/guide_modification_pok3r_media_volume_controls_hw/))
- `Fn+Q` - Previous Song
- `Fn+E` - Next Song
- `Fn+W` - Play/Pause Song
- `Fn+S` - Volume up
- `Fn+D` - Volume down
- `Fn+F` - Mute

### getting rid of capslock key
The Capslock Key is by far the most useless key for me. So i want to change this key to be the new `Fn`-Key. Thanks to Vortex they added this feature via the DIP-Switch 3 on the backside of the keyboard. Just enable the DIP-Switch and you are fine.
